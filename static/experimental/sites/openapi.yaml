                      AEM is an extensible and rich platform made for
                      developers, ranging from backend developers integrating
                      with customer systems to frontend developers creating the
                      user experience.

                       This session looks at a day in the life of an AEM developer. It starts with local development leveraging the SDK and using all the available tools for developing and testing locally. Different strategies on how to manage team development with git and Cloud Manager are covered as well as how to finally test and deploy the change in Cloud Service. The session covers the latest available features of AEM as a Cloud Service and will provide a glimpse into the future.

                      <p>AEM Content &amp; Commerce using the Commerce
                      Integration Framework (CIF) provide a flexible
                      architecture to connect AEM with Adobe Commerce or any
                      other commerce solution – of the shelf or in house.
                      GraphQL plays an essential role for AEM Content &amp;
                      Commerce and the CIF.</p>

                      <p>This talk discusses the patterns and architecture for
                      commerce solutions which are not compatible out of the box
                      with the APIs used by the CIF. We introduce Adobe I/O
                      Firefly to serve as a middleware and connect your commerce
                      solution with AEM. In this talk we give an introduction
                      into how a flexible GraphQL API mapping and transformation
                      layer can be implemented using Adobe I/O Runtime.</p>

                      <p>The talk consists of 3 blocks.</p>

                      <ul>

                      <li>We start with an introduction &amp; architecture
                      overview of the integration pattern for AEM Content &amp;
                      Commerce using CIF.</li>

                      <li>Going to hands on code and getting started with Adobe
                      I/O Firefly and deploy our CIF GraphQL reference
                      implementation.</li>

                      <li>And showing a real-world integration of AEM + CIF +
                      SAP Commerce using a CIF GraphQL build for Adobe I/O
                      Firefly.</li>

                      </ul>

                      <p>While the showcased integration is focused on commerce
                      use case the general integration pattern and usage of
                      Adobe I/O Firefly is adaptable to many other use cases as
                      well.</p>
